## Instructions

For this project you will recreate the Genius Plaza [About Us Page]('https://www.geniusplaza.com/en/aboutus/').  You will need the following endpoints:
* employee data: https://gp-frontend-exam.herokuapp.com/get_employees
* video: https://gp-frontend-exam.herokuapp.com/get_video

## Getting Started

To get started fork this repository and create feature branches.  The repository already has a starter [create react app]('https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app') project you can work with.  Make sure to make frequent and detailed commits.  Once you finish make a detailed pull request and send an email to Dylan@geniusplaza.com.

## Focus

This project is open ended but things to focus on include:

* Clean bug/error free code - a good way to avoid bug free code is through well thought out planning before implementation
* File Structure/Management
* Good and Latest React Practices - We stay up on the latest in the React/Javascript community here.  Showing that you do the same can be beneficial.
* Unit Testing - Either TDD/BDD are appreciated
* README - Your code should include a README describing the general implementation, and the build process if required.

*Focus first on creating a replica of the existing About Us page meeting these criteria.  After that you can consider implementing any additional features you would like.*
