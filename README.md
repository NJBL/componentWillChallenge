## Instructions

For this project you will recreate the Genius Plaza [About Us Page](https://www.geniusplaza.com/en/aboutus/) (header and footer excluded.)  You will need the following:

* employee data endpoint: https://gp-frontend-exam.herokuapp.com/get_employees

* video: https://www.geniusplaza.com/media/videos/Genius_Plaza_Hiring_Video.mp4

*All media files start with origin https://www.geniusplaza.com*

## Getting Started

To get started fork this repository and create feature branches.  The repository already has a starter [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project you can work with.  Make sure to make frequent and detailed commits.  Once you finish make a detailed pull request and send an email to Dylan@geniusplaza.com.

*[Good Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)*

## Focus

This project is open ended but things to focus on include:

* Clean bug/error free code - a good way to avoid bug free code is through well thought out planning before implementation
* File Structure/Management
* Good and Latest React Practices - We stay up on the latest in the React/Javascript community here.  Showing that you do the same can be beneficial.
* Unit Testing - Either TDD/BDD are appreciated
* README - Your code should include a README describing the general implementation, outline for future use of any reusable components/functions, and the build process if required.

*Focus first on creating a replica of the existing About Us page meeting these criteria.  After that you can implement any additional features to really show off your skills.*


## Extra Credit

If you would like more of a challenge implement a Drag and Drop Note Page.  Something in the design of [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jNPTiiVB/untitled-board). ![Trello Boards](./trello-example.png)

Features are up to you but could include things such as:
* add list
* remove list
* add card
* edit card
* remove card
* card descriptions
* data persistence
* drag card to new list
* attach image to card
* set card due date

*There is no need to create a separate application, you can implement routing or any other mechanism you're familiar with to incorporate both projects in the repo*
